      <!-- History: The Founder -->
      <div class="company-section">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          DIY Accounting was founded by Terry Cartwright, a Chartered Management Accountant (ACMA) and Chartered Company Secretary (ACIS),
          who began designing payroll and accounting systems on Excel spreadsheets in 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terry passed away in December 2009 and the company is now managed by his children: Antony, Jane, Samantha, Lindsey, and Daniel.
        </p>

          <p>
            Terry Cartwright qualified as a Chartered Management Accountant (ACMA) in 1971 and went on to design a revenue budgeting system
            for British Rail. He served as Management and Works Accountant at New World Gas Cookers before qualifying as a Chartered Company
            Secretary (ACIS).
          </p>
          <p>
            At British Steel he was promoted to Head of Finance and Administration for the Refractories division. He later worked in Saudi
            Arabia as Chief Accountant for an American corporation, and on returning to the UK became Chief Accountant at Dunlop Industrial
            Hose.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early 1980s Terry started his own retail and wholesale company, growing it to multiple outlets with turnover approaching
            &pound;1 million. In the early 1990s he returned to accountancy, working on a European sales accounting system, Oracle software
            implementations, and a treasury management system for a UK bank, before serving as Finance Director for a communications
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Semi-retiring around 2000, Terry pursued ornithology alongside maintaining financial accounts for industrial companies. In 2006
            he started DIY Accounting, applying his decades of experience to designing practical payroll and accounting systems on Excel
            spreadsheets. As a Chartered Company Secretary he also acted as a company formation agent.
